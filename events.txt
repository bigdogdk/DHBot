Currently the Halloween Mini Event is underway. You can find more information at http://www.descendantsofhonor.com/forums/topic/969-halloween-mini-event/

Our Guild Warts event has been delayed due to the HoT launch. We will have it some time before Wintersday. Stay tuned for more information.

HoT launches on the 23rd. We will be running missions on the 24th, and assuming we earn enough favor will be claiming our guild hall on the 25th. More specifics will be available at launch.
